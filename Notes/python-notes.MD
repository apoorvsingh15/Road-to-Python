# Road to Python

## What is python?

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

## Why python is popular choice for developers?

Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.

## What is an interpreted language?

An interpreted language is a programming language which are generally interpreted, without compiling a program into machine instructions. It is one where the instructions are not directly executed by the target machine, but instead read and executed by some other program. Interpreted language ranges â€“ JavaScript, Perl, Python, BASIC, etc.

## What is object oriented programming?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications; for example, OOP can be used for manufacturing system simulation software.

The organization of an object-oriented program also makes the method beneficial to collaborative development, where projects are divided into groups. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency.

## What are the benefits of OOP?

Benefits of OOP include:

Modularity - Encapsulation enables objects to be self-contained, making troubleshooting and collaborative development easier.
Reusability - Code can be reused through inheritance, meaning a team does not have to write the same code multiple times.
Productivity - Programmers can construct new programs quicker through the use of multiple libraries and reusable code.
Easily upgradable and scalable. Programmers can implement system functionalities independently.
Interface descriptions - Descriptions of external systems are simple, due to message passing techniques that are used for objects communication.
Security - Using encapsulation and abstraction, complex code is hidden, software maintenance is easier and internet protocols are protected.
Flexibility - Polymorphism enables a single function to adapt to the class it is placed in. Different objects can also pass through the same interface.
